# Changelog

<p class="lead">All notable changes to CatalogueCanvas.</p>

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Released versions are tagged (see `v*` tags and the published `ghcr.io` image); earlier
pre-release entries are grouped by date.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-07-22

### Added
- Portfolio index entries are now links. Each thumbnail in the "Works" index jumps to that item's section (`#work-<id>`), in both the live deck and the static zip export.

### Changed
- Scroll-layout portfolios read as one continuous page: section rules are dropped everywhere except under the cover, which gains breathing room below it, and the index no longer repeats its heading or leaves a gap between pages.
- `scripts/coverage-to-codacy.sh` accepts `--auto`/`--yes`/`--skip-regenerate` so it can run unattended, and fetches a version-pinned Codacy reporter binary verified against its published SHA-512 checksum instead of piping a rolling installer script straight into `bash`.
- Web coverage thresholds now sit just below the measured level (lines 75, statements 72, functions 60, branches 60). The previous `branches: 80` floor was above actual coverage and failed the coverage run outright, while the lines/statements floors of 30 were far below it.
- Dependency bumps: `codeql-action` init/analyze, `astral-sh/setup-uv`, `coverage`, `fastapi`, React/Vite/typescript-eslint minor-patch group, and `@testing-library/jest-dom` (major, 6→7).

### Fixed
- Docker builds no longer report success when they fail. A `;` before a trailing `true` ended the `&&` chain in the dependency-install step, so `true` set the step's exit status and a failing `uv sync --frozen` or `apk del` still produced an image. The cache-purge failure is now suppressed with a braced `{ ...; || true; }` group, which scopes the guard to that one command; a bare trailing `|| true` would have applied to the whole chain and masked the same failures.
- Codacy token parsing no longer strips spaces from inside the token value; only surrounding whitespace and quotes are trimmed.

### Security
- Bumped `brace-expansion` (transitive, via eslint/minimatch) to 5.0.7, fixing a ReDoS vulnerability ([GHSA-3jxr-9vmj-r5cp](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3jxr-9vmj-r5cp)).

## [0.1.5] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- Configurable LLM response wait timeout, set from Settings (default 90s) and applied to both single-item and batch description generation. The setting notes that for local LLM instances (Ollama, LM Studio) the right value is found by experience, since slow hardware or a cold model load can exceed 90 seconds.
- "View items" link on each collection that opens the main Items page filtered to that collection (via a `?collection=` URL parameter), with a clearable filter chip showing the active collection.

### Changed
- Item page now shows only an item's selected collections as chips by default, with an "Edit" button that reveals the full collection checklist and collapses back after saving. Previously every available collection was listed for every item, which grew unwieldy as collections accumulated.
- Reworded the update-check help text in Settings for clarity.

### Fixed
- Prev/next navigation arrows on the item page no longer clip at the glyph tips; their horizontal offset is nudged inward.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- Item images open at full size. Clicking the preview on an item page opens a lightbox that fits the image to the screen, toggles to 1:1 on click, and pans by dragging. Previews were already stored at full resolution, so no new assets are generated. Arrow-key item navigation is suspended while the lightbox is open.
- Portfolio layout option, chosen per portfolio and independent of the theme: `slide` (the existing full-height deck, printable to PDF at 1920×1080) or `scroll` (a continuous one-page site with no page breaks and no print button). Any of the four themes can be published either way. Applies to the live portfolio and the static zip export. Existing portfolios default to `slide`.

### Fixed
- The lightbox now fits the image to the screen at all times. Clicking to zoom to 1:1 opened large images past the edge of the viewport, so the zoom and drag-to-pan behaviour is gone.
- "Preview deck" and the portfolio list's "View" button now carry the share token. Both linked to the untokenized URL, which returns 404 for a gated portfolio.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- Opt-in update check. An admin-only `/api/version` endpoint queries GitHub for the latest release (weekly throttle, no network unless enabled) and the footer surfaces when a newer version is available. Configurable from Settings.

### Fixed
- LLM descriptions are now stored identically whether generated for a single item or in batch. Both paths use a shared `describeResultToNote` helper, so the full summary and bullet list are saved to the note instead of only the summary in the batch flow.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed
- LLM description pipeline: preview images (stored as WebP) were sent to the vision endpoint under a hardcoded `data:image/jpeg` label, so the bytes never matched the declared MIME type. This worked only on lenient runtimes and failed with `HTTP 400 Failed to load image or audio file` on LM Studio versions that trust the declared type (which accepts only jpeg/png). Previews are now transcoded to real JPEG before the request, and undecodable images raise a clear error.
- Footer now displays the correct app version. `web/package.json` version was left at the default `0.0.0`, which Vite injects as `__APP_VERSION__` and the footer renders; bumped it to `0.1.1` to match the release.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-08

### Security
- Bumped dependencies via Dependabot (consolidated): raised Python floors (fastapi 0.139.0, uvicorn 0.51.0, markdown 3.10.2, coverage 7.15.0, respx 0.23.1), web devDependencies (@types/node 26.1.1, @vitest/coverage-v8 4.1.10, typescript-eslint 8.63.0, vite 8.1.3, vitest 4.1.10), and pinned GitHub Actions (docker setup-buildx 4.2.0, docker login 4.4.0, docker build-push 7.3.0, codeql-action 4.37.0, astral-sh/setup-uv 8.3.2).
- Earlier Dependabot batch: pinned GitHub Actions (checkout, upload-artifact, docker login/setup-buildx/metadata) and raised Python (fastapi, uvicorn, cairosvg, passlib, python-multipart) and web npm floors.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- Token-secured shared portfolio links: opt-in per-portfolio share token gates the public deck so a link without the token returns a 404; a valid token sets a cookie so the recipient can revisit without re-pasting it. Admins can require, regenerate, disable, and copy the link from the portfolio editor. Live server only — static exports remain unlisted.

## 2026-06-20

### Added
- CSV batch metadata editing: export catalogue metadata to CSV, re-import edits with a preview of pending changes, and per-import lz4 backups.

### Changed
- Updated repository links and footer.

### Security
- Hardened Docker secret defaults.
- Hardened request throttling, archive downloads, and exports.
- Added revocable sessions and CSRF protection.
- Hardened the secret key handling and gated storage access.

## 2026-06-19

### Added
- Floating activity tray that tracks long-running background work (uploads, batch and single-item LLM descriptions) across page navigation.

### Changed
- Cookies default to insecure over plain HTTP for LAN/local testing.
- Updated README.

## 2026-06-18

### Added
- Multi-user mode with admin and read-only reader roles.
- Username-based login, reader downloads, an HTML 404 page, and a diagnostics endpoint/report.
- Full-text metadata search across title, notes, tags, and flattened item metadata.
- Per-item JSON-LD export (schema.org / Dublin Core) with the persistent item ID embedded for FAIR-style harvesting.
- Batch LLM description button with per-batch API key prompt.

### Changed
- Session signing key is now generated at the Docker entrypoint; LLM API URL is parsed and completed as needed.
- Raised the LLM request timeout to 90 seconds.
- Strip LLM reasoning from generated descriptions.

### Fixed
- lz4 raw file download served correctly.
